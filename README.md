# gioMINT - ETH Denver 2025 BUIDLathon Submission

## What is gioMINT?
gioMINT is an AI-powered NFT minter that makes it easy and fun for non-coders to create NFTs for real-world assets (RWA) like opals, watches, and jewelry on the Base blockchain. It uses AI to suggest NFT ideas and mints them via smart contracts, binding ownership and value securely.

## How It Works
- Users input a photo, description, or item (e.g., “Bright Opal #1” or “Rolex Watch”).
- The AI suggests NFT details, and users mint via a Coinbase Wallet on Base using web3.js and Hardhat.
- Data flows from user input to AI suggestions, then to the blockchain, securing assets on-chain.

## Problem It Solves
gioMINT makes NFT creation accessible to everyone, not just tech experts. It prevents ownership disputes, proves asset legitimacy, and enables collateral for loans, insurance, and more—without coding.

## Technologies Used
- Solidity, HTML, JavaScript, web3.js, Hardhat, Base Sepolia, Coinbase Wallet, Based AI AgentKit
